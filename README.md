# Vic's Point Blank Content Packager

A very simple mod coded by someone who is barely decent at java

Vic's Point Blank mod allows content packs to be loaded through .../pointblank/ folder in game directory, this system however does not fit well with curseforge and the content pack creators cannot properly share their content packs with curseforge.

This mod allows them to do so by making their content packs in form of a mod with no code but the content additions.
